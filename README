  grant you a license to treat this program in every way as if it were in

DESCRIPTION

  This package contains a single program, tai64nfrac, which given data
  with TAI64N timestamps as input (such as data generated by multilog),
  will convert those times to seconds since epoch (with a fractional part)
  and otherwise output the same data.

  This is primarily intended to support using qmailanalog to analyze qmail
  logs that are being written by multilog rather than to syslog via
  splogger.  The program is extremely simple.


INSTALLATION

  Just run make to compile the software.  It should compile without
  modification on any Unix or Unix varient, and likely on most systems
  that support ANSI C.  The result will be a binary named tai64nfrac.

  You can copy this binary to wherever is convenient, or type make install
  to install it and its man page.  By default, the binary is installed
  into /usr/local/bin and the man page into /usr/local/man/man1; you can
  change the install location with a command like:

      make install prefix=/opt/sw

  or you can also set bindir or man1dir directly (or edit the Makefile to
  change them if you want).
