=head1 NAME

tai64nfrac - Convert TAI64N timestamps to decimal seconds since epoch

=head1 SYNOPSIS

tai64nfrac < I<input> > I<output>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given data with TAI64N timestamps at the beginning of each line as input
(such as data generated by multilog), B<tai64nfrac> will convert those
times to seconds since epoch (with a fractional part) and otherwise output
the same data.  It's intended to be used as a filter that changes the
timestamp format at the beginning of each line.

B<tai64nfrac> is primarily intended to support using qmailanalog to
analyze qmail logs that are being written by multilog rather than to
syslog via splogger.

=head1 BUGS

B<tai64nfrac> makes no attempt to handle leap seconds.  The time since
epoch may be in TAI rather than in UTC, which may not be what your system
expects.

=head1 SEE ALSO

See L<http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/tai64nlocal.html> for documentation of
B<tai64nlocal>, which converts TAI64N timestamps to human-readable times
in the local time zone.
